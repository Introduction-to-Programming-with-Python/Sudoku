_**This project is not completed yet.**_

This project aims to apply some programming foundations concepts and Python functionalities applied to sudoku game visualizator and validator.

## Respository structure

- The file [code.py](/code.py) contains the code of this project.
- The folder [documentation](/documentation/) contains the repository documentation files and context about this project.
- The folder [data](/data/) contains the sudoku data sources.

## Statement

This [document](/documentation/statement.pdf) contains the context of the problem, requirments and functionality for each file and function.

## Objectives

This project aims to apply the following functionalities:

- Manage lists of lists.

## How does it work?

Once you execute the application, the options will be displayed by the console and you can start to navegate and interact with the program with the console. The responses will be showed in the console too.

## Execution

To execute the program you have to execute the [code.py](/code.py) file.

Before any other option, in each execution you have to introduce a valid txt file that contains a sudoku serie to load and be able to continue with the other optionns. The txt file name can be "faciles.txt", "dificiles.txt" or "intermedios.txt".

If you want to add another txt file that contains a sudoku serie, you should add it to the [data](/data/) folder.
